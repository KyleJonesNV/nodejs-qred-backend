## Backend

Built with `nodejs` and `express`.

## Database

`Postgres` and `knex`

## Testing

`Supertest`
I've included integration tests for each endpoint

## Frontend

I went ahead and built a quick frontend to showcase the API, can be found here: [Frontend-Qred](https://github.com/KyleJonesNV/frontend-q).

# Improving collaboration between Frontend and Backend

1. Have a workshop together to sketch out the API and data types before building anything.

At the end of the workshop, the team should have a sketch similar to the one above.

2. Mock data while the API is being developed.

Once the API and data types are defined, the frontend can mock the returned data from the API and continue developing in parallel. 
It should be quick to switch out the mocked endpoints once the API is ready.

3. Sit together often.

Being in close proximity encourages collaboration and builds relationships. This creates a low barrier to ask any question and to resolve uncertainties quickly.

4. When possible, take small tickets from the opposite side.

Frontenders take small tickets from backend and vice versa (perhaps one every sprint). 
This can develop everyone's understanding and make members of the team better developers in general. 
It also encourages collaboration as the team shares more responsibility.
